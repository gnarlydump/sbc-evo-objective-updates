fut.gg -> Discord notifier

Checks fut.gg for newly-added Evolutions, SBCs, and Objectives, and posts
each to its own Discord webhook. Designed to run on a schedule (see
.github/workflows/check.yml) via GitHub Actions, but works fine run locally
too.

How it gets data:
  fut.gg is a client-rendered app (TanStack Start) that embeds its page data
  in a global `window.__TSR_ROUTER__` object once loaded. There's no public
  JSON API for most pages, so this script uses Playwright (headless
  Chromium) to load each page for real and pull the data out of that object
  directly -- the exact same data structure the site itself renders from.
  SBCs are the one exception: fut.gg moved that page to a paginated
  client-side API (see SBC_API below), so we call that endpoint directly
  instead.

State:
  Previously-seen ids for each category are stored in state/state.json. On
  the very first run (no ids recorded yet for a category), the script seeds
  the file with everything currently live WITHOUT posting -- otherwise
  you'd get 200+ messages dumped into your channel on the first run. Every
  run after that only posts genuinely new items.

Rate limiting:
  Discord webhooks reject requests sent too fast (~5 per 2 seconds). Posts
  are spaced out with a short delay, and a 429 (rate limited) response is
  retried automatically rather than treated as a failure.

Role pings:
  Setting EVOLUTIONS_ROLE_ID / SBC_ROLE_ID / OBJECTIVES_ROLE_ID pings that
  role at the start of the announcement message (e.g. so your "New SBC"
  reaction-role members get notified). Leave any of them unset to post
  without a ping for that category.
